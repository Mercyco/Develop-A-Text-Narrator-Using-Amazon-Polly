# Develop-A-Text-Narrator-Using-Amazon-Polly
Developing a text narrator using Amazon Polly.

**Project Overview**
We will be developing a text narrator using Amazon Polly. A piece of text (book, article, newsletter) will be uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket and converted to speech. 
The voice, pitch, and speed parameters can be adjusted to tailor the speech output.

**Steps to be Performed**
In the following lessons, we will go through these steps:

1. Exploring Amazon Polly

Introduction to Amazon Polly.
Understanding how Amazon Polly works and its features.
Exploring different voices and speech parameters available in Amazon Polly.

2. Creating an IAM Role

Setting up an IAM role with the necessary permissions.
Understanding the security best practices for IAM roles.

3. Creating an S3 Bucket

Setting up an Amazon S3 bucket to store the text files.
Configuring S3 bucket policies for secure access.

4. Writing Lambda Function Code

Writing AWS Lambda functions to automate the process of text-to-speech conversion.
Deploying and testing the Lambda functions.

5. Checking the Output of Amazon Polly

Verifying the audio output generated by Amazon Polly.
Making adjustments to the voice, pitch, and speed parameters as needed.

**Services Used** 
Amazon Polly: Converts text to lifelike speech with customizable features.
AWS Management Console: Manages accounts and configures Amazon Polly and other AWS services.
AWS IAM: Ensures secure access by managing user permissions.

**Detailed Steps**
1. Exploring Amazon Polly
Objective: Understand the capabilities of Amazon Polly.
**Tasks:**
Explore the Amazon Polly console.
Test different voices and speech parameters (e.g., pitch, speed).
2. Creating an IAM Role
Objective: Set up secure access for the services.
**Tasks:**
Create an IAM role with permissions for Amazon Polly and S3.
Attach the necessary policies to the IAM role.
3. Creating an S3 Bucket
Objective: Store text files that will be converted to speech.
**Tasks:**
Create a new S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
Set up appropriate permissions and policies for the S3 bucket.
4. Writing Lambda Function Code
Objective: Automate text-to-speech conversion using AWS Lambda.
**Tasks:**
Write a Lambda function to read text files from the S3 bucket.
Use Amazon Polly SDK to convert text to speech.
Save the audio output back to the S3 bucket.
5. Checking the Output of Amazon Polly
Objective: Ensure the generated speech meets the requirements.
**Tasks:**
Retrieve and listen to the audio files from the S3 bucket.
Make necessary adjustments to voice, pitch, and speed parameters.

**Conclusion**
By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional text narrator using Amazon Polly, with the ability to customize various speech parameters to suit your needs. This project leverages multiple AWS services to create an efficient and secure solution for text-to-speech conversion.
